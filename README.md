Facial Recognition Applications Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Overview

In this project, we implement a facial identification and emotion recognition model in real-time using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. The project combines Computer Vision techniques with Deep Learning to achieve accurate results.

Components

Facial Emotion Recognition
The emotion recognition model is implemented in Facial_Expression_Recognition_Model.ipynb. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks to classify emotions into 6 categories: Anger, Neutral, Fear, Happy, Sad, and Surprise. The trained model is saved as model.h5.

Facial Identification
Facial identification is performed using create_data.py. This script captures 30 frames of a subject's face via webcam and stores them at a specified location on the system.

Integration
main_new.py integrates both features into a single program. It accesses the webcam in real-time and performs both facial identification and emotion recognition on the subject.
